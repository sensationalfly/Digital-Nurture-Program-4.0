# Blogger App - A React Lab on Conditional Rendering

## Project Overview

This "Blogger App" is a project I built as part of `Digital Nurture 4.0 program`. The main objective was to get comfortable with **conditional rendering** in React. The app displays three different types of contentâ€”Course Details, Book Details, and Blog Details. The cool part is that you can use the buttons to choose which components to display on the screen.

## What I Learned in This Lab

This assignment was super helpful! I got to implement several important React concepts:

* **Creating Multiple Components:** I practiced breaking down the UI into smaller, manageable pieces by creating separate components for `CourseDetails`, `BookDetails`, and `BlogDetails`.

* **Passing Data with Props:** I learned how to pass data from a parent component (`App.js`) down to child components. All the course, book, and blog data is stored in `App.js` and sent to the components that need it.

* **Rendering Lists with `.map()`:** I used the `.map()` function to loop through arrays of data. This was much better than hardcoding each list item. I also remembered to use the `key` prop, which React needs to keep track of items in a list.

* **Conditional Rendering Techniques:** This was the main focus of the lab. I implemented a few different methods:
    1.  **`useState` and a `switch` statement:** I used a state variable to hold the current view (`'all'`, `'books'`, etc.). A function with a `switch` statement then returns the correct component(s) based on this state. This felt like the most organized way to handle multiple options.
    2.  **Logical `&&` Operator:** I used this for a simple case: `show === 'all' && <h1>...</h1>`. It was a quick and easy way to render something only if a condition is true.
    3.  **Ternary Operator:** I used the ternary operator (`condition ? if_true : if_false`) to show a different message in the footer depending on whether all components were visible or just one.

* **Basic CSS with Flexbox:** I used CSS Flexbox to create the three-column layout and added a vertical green line between the columns to match the assignment's screenshot.
